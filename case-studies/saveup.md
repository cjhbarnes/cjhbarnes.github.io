### Project
SaveUP is an application which allows users to easily track how much they are saving. I decided to develop SaveUP after personally finding existing apps were either too complex or could not be synced properly with my account.

### Sketching ideas
My projects all start in one place: my sketchbook. Sketching and writing help me to freely explore ideas which naturally evolves into flows and UI sketches. Below are some images of my early ideas for SaveUP.

### Keeping it simple
The main aim of SaveUP is to allow users to simply track how much they are saving. With user experience at the forefront of my mind, I didn’t want to distract the user from their objective so I avoided a complicated design and needless extra features. I kept it simple.

                <p>This page allows users to set their savings goal.</p>
                <p>I debated whether to allow users to create more than one goal, or edit existing goals. I believe, however, that this would overcomplicate an application and feel that its better to focus on one specific goal than trying to achieve multiple goals.</p>

                <h4>Tracking your savings</h4>
                <p>I didn’t just want to provide users with an overview of their account balance and progress towards achieving their savings goal. Knowing how much you save each month, and even each year, makes it easier to manage your finances. As such I felt it important to show users this information on the tracking screen too. </p>
