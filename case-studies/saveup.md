### Project
SaveUP is an application which allows users to easily track how much they are saving. I decided to design and build SaveUP as the existing savings apps didn't meet my needs as my Brazilian bank account can't sync with the app or the apps where just too complex.

### Sketching ideas
I usually start all my projects in my sketchbook. Sketching and writing help me to freely explore ideas. Sometime I note down a few words, or list what it needs to do, just to get it out of my head and onto paper.

This naturally evolves into flows and UI sketches. Sometimes I’ll sketch a feature, or a small UI detail, or a new approach to the UI entirely. It’s a quick way of purely and simply designing and exploring ideas without getting distracted.

### Keeping it simple
The aim of SaveUP is to allow users to simply track how much they’re saving. I didn’t want to complicate the design or add extra features, I felt that this would hurt the overall experience as it would distract the user from their main aim of see how much they are saving - I wanted to keep it simple.

                <p>I debated whether to allow users to create more than one goal, or edit existing goals. But in the end I decided that its better to focus on one specific goal than trying to acheive multiple.</p>

                <p>Not only did I want to provide users with an overview of their account balance and progress towards hitting their goal. I also wanted to provide them with some other useful information suchs as; much did they save last month, how much are they on track to save this year and how much have they saved to date.</p>
