    <p>Originally from Somerset, England. I now live in Florianópolis, Brazil with my lovely wife, daughter and Patrick our dog. I’ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely on projects for leading e-commerces, local businesses and startups. UX and problem solving are central to everything I do. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved at different stages of a project, from the seed of the idea, through to sketches, wireframes, design and even the front-end build. </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I’ve been doing this professionally for 6 years. In 2014 I was invited to work at a company called Chaordic, an e-commerce peronsalisation company, to take on the role as the UX designer for their search product. Most recently, in 2015 my role was extended to included being responsive for the UX for all of Chaordic’s analytical tools and creating and maintaining a design system for their dashboards. During my time with Chaordic I have also been involved with the frontend development of numerous projects which use frameworks such as Angular and React.</p>
    <p>Pre 2014 I worked freelance as a web designer and front-end developer creating websites for individuals and local companies. The skills I learnt during this period formed the backbone of my career - it made me the designer I am today.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Before designing full-time, I was a competitive sailor, dinghy racing coach and diving instructor in the UK, Europe and Australia. My mind is never too far from the ocean, and I appreciate the importance of a healthy work/life balance. So when I’m not online, you’ll find me outdoors — surfing, swimming, snowboarding or travelling.</p>
