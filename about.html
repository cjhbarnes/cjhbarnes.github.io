    <p>I am originally from Somerset, England. I now live in Florianópolis, Brazil with my lovely wife, daughter and Patrick our dog. I’ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely on projects for leading e-commerces, local businesses and startups. UX and problem solving are central to everything I do. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved at different stages of a project, from the seed of the idea, through to sketches, wireframes, design and even the front-end build. </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have been working professionally for six years. In 2014 I was invited to work at Chaordic, an e-commerce personalisation company, taking on the role as the UX designer for their search product. More recently I took on the responsibility for the UX for all of Chaordic’s analytical tools, as well as creating and maintaining a design system for their dashboards. Whilst working for Chaordic, I have also been actively involved with the front-end development of numerous projects using frameworks such as Angular and React.</p>
    <p>Pre 2014 I worked freelance as a web designer and front end designer, creating websites for individuals and local companies. The skills I learnt during this period formed the backbone of my career, making me the designer I am today.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Before designing full-time, I was a competitive sailor, dinghy racing coach and diving instructor in the UK, Europe and Australia. My mind is never too far from the ocean, and I appreciate the importance of a healthy work/life balance. So when I’m not online, you’ll find me outdoors — surfing, swimming, snowboarding or travelling.</p>
