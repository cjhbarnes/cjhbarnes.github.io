    <p>I’ve worked internationally, in-house and remotely on projects for leading e-commerces, central government sectors, regulatory bodies, large enterprise projects and startups. UX and problem solving are central to everything I do. I care deeply about making products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved in all the different stages of a project, from the seed of the idea, through to sketches, wireframes, design and even some front-end code.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have been working professionally for eight years. I currently work as a Senior Product Designer for Consensys, designing private blockchain solutions for a variety of clients. Prior to this, as a Senior UX Designer for Civica Digtal I worked with clients who where undergoing large digital transformations. In 2014 I was invited to work at Chaordic, an e-commerce personalisation startup, taking on the role as the UX designer for their search product then later becoming responsible for the UX for all of administration dashboards and analytical tools.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Before designing full-time, I was a competitive sailor, dinghy racing coach and diving instructor in the UK, Europe and Australia. My mind is never too far from the ocean, and I appreciate the importance of a healthy work/life balance. So when I’m not online, you’ll find me outdoors — surfing, swimming, snowboarding or travelling.</p>
