<h3 id="the-project">The project</h3>
<p>Whilst redesigning the integration process the we noticed that there was a lack of internal metrics regarding the integration process. This created 3 problems for company:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It hard for the company to accuratly plan when the recurring revenue from the client would enter the cashflow, evalabourate budgets and set financial goals.</li>
  <li>Project owners had very little insight into how long their product takes to integration and where to invest time and effort to reduce the integrations time.</li>
  <li>The customer service managers found it hard to evenly distrubute new integration projects among the project managers as they had to consult a number of spreadsheets to see how many integrations each of there project managers were co-ordinating and any giving time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore our aim was to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provide upper management with insights to how much revenue will be entering each month and when.</li>
  <li>Provide project owners with insights as to where to invest in order to make the integration of their products quicker.</li>
  <li>Provide customer service managers a clear breakdown of how their project managers are distrubuted.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="developing-personas">Developing personas</h3>

<p>As the project indeed to meet the needs of 4 different users I felt that it was important that the design team invested time and effort in developing personas for each of the target users so that the whole team (design and development) could better understand, design and implement solutions base on the target users needs</p>

<figure><img src="/images/metrics--personas.png" alt="User personas for the project" /></figure>

<h3 id="what-metrics-to-show">What metrics to show</h3>

<p>We ran brainstorming sessions with upper management, directors, product owners and the integration team to generate ideas as to what metrics we could show on the dashboard and we had the information needed to create the metric.</p>

<p>Once we narrowed the list down we ran card sorting exercises to better understand how we can organise the the metrics on the interface.</p>

<h4 id="overview-screen">Overview screen</h4>

<p>Our aim with this screen was to give project managers, customer service managers and directors a snapshot of the active integrations, how the teams progress is in relation to their goal and how much revenue being integrated.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/metrics--overview.png" alt="Wireframes" /></figure>

<h4 id="task-breakdown">Task breakdown</h4>

<p>This screen is aimmed to solve the needs of the product owners by showing them the which tasks take the longest and which generate the most errors. This information can be shown for all products which would be useful for customer service managers and can be filtered for each product for product owners.</p>

<h4 id="integration-breakdown">Integration breakdown</h4>

<p>This screen shows the breakdown of how many integration projects each Technical Account Manager to co-ordinating at the same time. This screen enabled customer service managers to distrubute new integration projects between the Technical Account Managers more effeintly. This has helped to reduce the time of each integration by an average of 10%.</p>
