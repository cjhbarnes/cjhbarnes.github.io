<h3 id="the-project">The project</h3>
<p>In late 2015 I led a project to redesign the process of integrating our clients and their e-commerce platform with our products. The integration system in use was causing clients to become disengaged, causing processes to be delayed and therefore delaying the recurring revenue entering the company. The goal of this project was to improve the client’s experience so they would become more engaged in the integration process and reduce the number of delays.</p>

<h3 id="the-current-process">The current process</h3>
<p>First, we needed to gain an understanding of the current integration process. We interviewed both external and internal clients of various teams and created a number of customer journey maps where we documented objectives, tools used, tasks and most importantly the pain points of current integration process.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/process--cjm-1.jpg" alt="TAM customer journey mapping" /></figure>

<h3 id="what-needed-to-be-fixed">What needed to be fixed</h3>
<p>During the mapping exercise it became apparent that we had to solve the following problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Large number of documents and tools scattered throughout the process, leading to confusion between client and project manager.</li>
  <li>Decentralisation of information about the process.</li>
  <li>Large amount of rework to validate files sent by clients.</li>
  <li>Lengthy period between signing of the proposal and activation of the company’s product(s) led to clients becoming disengaged with the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these points in mind we proposed a new integration process (see images below). The Integration Dashboard, by centralising 90% of the required information, greatly reduced the number of tools and employees involved in the integration process. With management, tools and information in one place, there was no longer an issue with scattered documents and tools, and both the project manager and the client were able to manage the integration project leading to less confusion and quicker turnarounds.</p>

  </ul>

<h3 id="building-the-mvp">Building the MVP.</h3>
<p>A prototype of the integration dashboard was built and then tested with both internal and external clients. Once we had proved that our solution enhanced the customer experience, we worked closely with the development team to implement an MVP version of the dashboard, which can be seen below.</p>

<h4 id="overview-screen">Overview screen</h4>
<p>This screen is only accessible to employees of the company. It gives project managers, customer service managers and directors a snapshot of the active integrations and their progression. Project managers are able to create projects and then edit them directly in the dashboard, enabling us to reduce the number of tools needed within the integration process.</p>

<h4 id="project-screen">Project screen</h4>
<p>The client is taken directly to this screen after logging in, where they are given a clear overview of the integration process both generally and for each individual task.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/process--project.png" alt="Integration overview screen" /></figure>

<h4 id="task-screen">Task screen</h4>
<p>The customer journey mapping highlighted a significant problem: the client was required to input the file or URL in a separate area to their documentation. This lengthened the time clients needed to complete tasks, causing frustration and questions. The task screen was created with this in mind. By joining the documentation and input for seamless completion of tasks, as well as incorporating comment areas, the client is provided with all the information and support needed in one place.</p>
